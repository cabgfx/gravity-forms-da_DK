# Gravity Forms danish translation files

Danish translations for core files of the Gravity Forms WordPress plugin. No add-ons translations (yet).

Written against Gravity Forms v1.7.6

## Usage

Download the .mo file and place it in the plugin languages directory (that's `wp-content/plugins/gravityforms/languages/`).
That's all.

## Updates

Will occur sporadically, when/if needed.

## Contribution

See a typo? Grammar mistake? Fork the project and send a Pull Request. I strongly recommend using [POEdit](http://www.poedit.net/download.php) for working with the translations.

## More info

See the [Gravity Forms translations page](http://www.gravityhelp.com/downloads/translations/) and the info about the plugin itself at [gravityforms.com](http://gravityforms.com/).

## LICENSE

None. It's all yours, baby.
